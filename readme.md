# Of digestive biscuits, old leather, and smoked ham: making sense of the language of Scotch whisky

Somewhere in the world – even as we speak – there is a group of friends sitting
near a fireplace in a cozy house. It’s autumn and its damp and starting to get
a bit chilly outside. The friends are warm. There is soft talking and thoughtful
pauses. There are glasses in their hands. Golden red elixir swooshes back and
forth. One of them hold the glass up to the fire, sees light dancing through
gold, swishes the glass and tilts. Fingers of liquid gold slide down the side of
the glass. Now the glass goes up to the mouth: a slow slip. The mouth chews
the liquid. Swallows. Inhales and exhales.
Then the mouth speaks: ”I think I’m getting some orange peel, maybe a
little pepper in the finish.”
There is a small pause.
Then another voice: ”I’ve got some red chilli and a bit of oak.”
The rest ponder these statements. Orange and shadow flickers over faces.
The question is: are these people agreeing? Are they saying similar things
but using different descriptors? Or are they tasting very different things? Taste
and smell are tricky to delineate. After a few simple common descriptors (sweet,
spicy, etc.) one immediately finds oneself in the jungle of metaphor and simile.
And Scotch single malt whisky can be a complex thing indeed. There are many
(in some cases, rather strange) similies/metaphors used to describe Scotch. The
goal of this work is to try and build a list of words used to describe the tastes
and smell of Scotch and then to discover groups of such descriptors. The hope
is that these groups give us general types of flavor/smell profiles present in the
entire domain of Scotch whisky. This will also help us to understand a given
Scotch’s taste profile by its breakdown according to these groups.
